<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I am a Mechanical Engineer, with a Master's Degree from Michigan Technological University. 
  I am specialized in Design, Analysis and Manufacturing of Plastics. 
  <br/>
  While the whole world is booming towards using cheaper and lighter weighted materials, 
  plastics can fill that need. 
  With this learning, I started my first job working as a Project Engineer with Calsonic Kansei,
  which is a Nissan Tier-1 company. Calsonic Kansei supports the Cock-Pit Module section on all 
  the United States based cars.</p>
