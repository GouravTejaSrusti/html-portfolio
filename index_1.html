        <h2>Let's understand if we are on the same page!!</h2>
        <p>Organisations are looking for active thinkers who are capable of observing things, analyse observations and generate ideas.</p>
        <h2>Where do I wish to head in 2025?</h2>
        <p>I am looking to work in an organisation where people love the work they do and are compatible with the bosses. Where they see that they have a purpose to wake up and get to work.</p>
            <p>I am a thinker, who can wait until the desired results are achieved. I see results as a destination in the path to openness.
            Why did I mention "wait"? Because it requires Patience to wait, and patience is the key to success.</p>

        <h2>Where did I invest my time in the last 6 years and what skills have I sharpened? </h2>
        <h3>Student from October 2023- October 2024</h3>
        <p>My love for social service forced me to quit the high paying job in the US to test my fate as a Group 1 Officer in the Telangana State.</p>
        <p>I did learn the syllabus, but importantly I experienced Life. When you have to stay home for 365 days, with the result unknown is a real test of below qualities
            <ol>
                <li>Patience</li>
                <li>Persistence</li>
                <li>Self-Accountability</li>
                <li>Consistence</li>
                <li>Courage</li>
                <li>Ability to trust in yourself</li>
            </ol>
            Sounds great! Isn't it?
